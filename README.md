# Intelligent Data Analysis Tool

The tool is based on the management of a dataset using the Python programming language.

IDAT is intended to implement the CRISP-DM data mining methodology on the selected dataset. Therefore, we can perform:

1. **Business understanding**: What does the business need?
2. **Data understanding**: What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
3. **Data preparation**: How do we organize the data for modeling?
4. **Modeling**: What modeling techniques should we apply?
5. **Evaluation**: Which model best meets the business objectives?

For this version of the tool, the user is allowed to work with problems that focus on regression, classification or clustering.

The models that can be created to work with this type of problems are:

+ **Artificial Neural Network**
+ **Decision tree**
+ **Regression algorithm**
+ **KNN**

To run the application, it is necessary to install the dependencies needed by the application.

These can be found in the file ***requirements.txt***.

To install all the dependencies shown in the ***requirements.txt*** file, you have to  execute the following command in the terminal:

`$> pip install -r requirements.txt`
